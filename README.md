## Summary 

Considering the results from the visualizations above, we can see that majority of riders are men, thursday evenings are the most popular times, and majority of users are subscribers to the service. 

Additional suggestions: 
- We should perform this analysis on a different time of year. August will have lots of traffic due to the warm weather, however Winter may be quite dead, and could offset profits. 
- Also could look into the locations of where bikes are taken out, and put back. There may be evidence to suggest adding more bike stations in highly populated commuter suburbs.
